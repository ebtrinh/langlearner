🌍 First-Time User Journey
1. Landing Page (Hook & Clarity)

Big headline:
“Learn the phrases you’ll actually use while traveling.”

Sub-headline:
“No fluff. Just the words you need to eat, explore, and get around.”

Call-to-action button:
“Start Learning” / “Choose My Destination.”

2. Destination / Language Selector

User picks where they’re going (Mexico, France, Japan…).

Each option shows a little travel icon (🌮 taco for Mexico, 🗼 Eiffel Tower for France, etc.)

Behind the scenes, this sets the phrase/grammar packs.

3. Quick Onboarding Questions (Personalization)

Keep it super short (30–60 sec max). Example:

“When are you traveling?” (This week / In a month / Just browsing)

“What’s your goal?” (Survive conversations / Build confidence / Both)

“How much time do you have to learn daily?” (5 min / 10 min / 20+ min)

👉 This helps the site suggest the right “track” (pure phrases vs. phrases + basics).

4. Dashboard Intro

The user lands on their personal travel dashboard:

A progress bar: “20 Essential Phrases Before Your Trip.”

Two tracks visible:

Survival Phrases (Quick Win) → “Order food,” “Ask for bathroom.”

Building Blocks (Basics) → “I want…,” “Where is…,” “Numbers 1–10.”

Suggested starting point: “Start with your first Survival Phrase: ‘I want the carnitas.’”

5. First Lesson Sneak Peek

The very first lesson should:

Teach a phrase immediately (no delays).

Show the translation + audio.

Then break it down into building blocks (word meanings, sentence skeleton).

End with a practice activity (swap in a new word, e.g., tacos → agua).

So within 2 minutes, the user feels like:
✅ They can say something useful.
✅ They understand why it works.
✅ They’ve practiced applying it.

6. Gentle Nudge at End of Lesson

Congratulate them (“You just learned your first phrase!”).

Offer the next step: “Learn how to ask where the bathroom is.”

Keep momentum with a travel-relevant preview: “These next 5 phrases will help you at a restaurant.”

🖼️ Visual Style

Minimal, mobile-first design (since travelers will often use phones).

Big audio play buttons (easy to tap in a hurry).

Card-based lessons (swipe left/right flashcards).

Icons & visuals (food, bathroom, taxi) for fast recognition.

✨ So as a brand-new user, your steps would feel like:
Landing → Choose destination → Quick personalization → Dashboard → First phrase immediately.

Do you want me to mock up a full “first 3 screens” walkthrough (like literally what text, buttons, and visuals the user sees) so you can picture it better?
